name: multi-tenancy
description: Isolate tenants in a Cratis application with Chronicle namespaces — Arc maps the current tenant to a namespace (TenantNamespaceResolver), and each namespace has its own events, projections, reducers, and read models. Every Cratis application is assumed multi-tenant, so use this when setting up tenancy, when writing code that touches events or data on behalf of a tenant, and when a single-tenant deployment has to grow a second tenant.

# Multi-Tenancy with Chronicle Namespaces

Chronicle implements multi-tenancy through **namespaces**: each namespace is a logically separate event store. Events, projections, reducers, and observers run independently per namespace — there is no cross-namespace leakage.

**Assume every Cratis application is multi-tenant.** A deployment serving one organization today is a multi-tenant application with one tenant in it — the second one arrives later, and the code that was written as if there would only ever be one is found from the far side of a data migration. Whether a deployment *configures* tenant resolution is an operational choice; whether the code is written to survive a second tenant is not.

Concretely, that means: no service holds tenant-scoped state for the process (see `csharp.md` — a `[Singleton]` must never take `IEventStore`, `IMongoCollection<T>`, or anything else resolved per scope), no tenant identifier is hard-coded, and every background flow states which tenant it acts for.

## Core concept

| Term | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Namespace | a named isolation boundary in Chronicle (its own event store) |
| Default namespace | `"Default"` — used when none is resolved |

All appends, projections, and observers are scoped to the resolved namespace. A reactor for `<Entity>Created` fires once per tenant namespace that has that event — independently.

## Arc tenancy integration

When using Arc with Chronicle, tenancy maps to namespaces automatically: Arc's `TenantNamespaceResolver` maps the current tenant id to the Chronicle namespace and falls back to the default namespace when no tenant is set. Enable Arc tenancy in startup so the tenant context resolves before each command/query handler runs; namespace wiring is then automatic — no manual resolver registration needed.

If you need custom namespace resolution outside Arc tenancy (header, subdomain, JWT claim), Chronicle supports namespace resolvers registered in priority order; the first non-null result wins, else the default namespace is used.

## Observer and reactor isolation

Observers (projections, reducers, reactors) are instantiated **per namespace**. Consequences:

- A `[OnceOnly]` reactor fires once **per event source within each namespace** (i.e. once per tenant), not globally once — see [reactors.md](https://github.com/Cratis/AI/blob/main/.ai/rules/reactors.md).
- Projection rewind affects only the target namespace.
- Each namespace has its own sequence numbers.

## Common pitfalls

| Pitfall | Why |
| --- | --- |
| Storing a tenant id on every event type | the namespace *is* the tenant — events don't need a tenant property |
| No tenant resolution in a multi-tenant deployment | every tenant lands in `"Default"` — no isolation |
| A `[Singleton]` holding `IEventStore`, `IMongoCollection<T>` or a `DbContext` | captures the root scope, so it is pinned to the default namespace forever — and it returns empty results rather than failing (`csharp.md`) |
| A process-wide or `static` cache of tenant data | shared by every tenant; the key must include the tenant |
| Reading one namespace and writing another in the same request | accidental cross-namespace access is a bug (intentional bridging is a Translation reactor) |
| Expecting `[OnceOnly]` to be globally once | it is per-namespace |

## Quality gate

- [ ] Build is clean.
- [ ] Tenant resolution is configured and resolves the expected namespace from test requests.
- [ ] No tenant identifier appears on `[EventType]` records.
- [ ] `[OnceOnly]` reactors are understood to fire per-namespace.
- [ ] No singleton holds tenant-scoped state, and every cache is keyed by tenant (`csharp.md`).
